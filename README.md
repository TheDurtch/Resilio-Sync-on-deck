I made ths set of scripts to help people install and run resilio sync on their steam decks and let them launch it in game mode (still testing)

Download install-resilio-sync.sh

Open Konsole and run "chmod +x install-resilio-sync.sh" in the same folder as the script

add script found in ~/bin called "Resilio-Sync" to steam

profit?
