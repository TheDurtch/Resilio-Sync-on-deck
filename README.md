I made ths set of scripts to help people install and run resilio sync on their steam decks and let them launch it in game mode

run "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDurtch/Resilio-Sync-on-deck/master/install-resilio-sync.sh | bash" Konsole on the steamdeck

add script found in ~/bin called "Resilio-Sync" to steam

It will launch a Konsole in Fullscreen mode and when you are done using sync hit 'q'

I will add options later on to ask if you want to run in the background and also if you want to have it bind to '127.0.0.1' or '0.0.0.0'
